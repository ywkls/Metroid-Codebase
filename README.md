# Metroid-Codebase

This game is not a standard Zelda Classic quest. There are several notable differences which will be expanded upon below.

Custom controls- The controls used for various actions in the game can be set to a number of preset variations which are then used to activate abilities. Buttons used include A, B, L, R, Ex1-Ex4 and the left mouse button.
No F6 feature- To prevent a certain amount of cheating and to adhere to the standard Metroid format, you may only quit by dying or going to a save point.
Item Usage- All items are used by pressing the Fire button. Select what item to use by pressing the Item Select button until that item is highlighted. If no item is highlighted, the equipped beam is used. Exceptions and the Metroid Helper and Atomizer. These are normally controlled by the L and R buttons.
Scripted subscreen- Interaction with the subscreen is via the left mouse button. Only the acquired beams may be adjusted this way, turned on or off.
Warp feature- All save points double as warp points to all other activated save points.
Examine Icon- An icon of Samus' visor with an exclamation point appears whenever an object can be examined. Press Examine to do so.
Scripted Map and Minimap- The map and minimap are drawn via scripts and will only display in full once you find the Map Station for that region. There are several false map stations around the world, but only one true station per main area.
